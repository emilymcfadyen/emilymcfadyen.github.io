		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I'm a freelance fundraiser, living in Seville, Spain. I left my job in London in 2010 and moved to Seville with a plan to stay for no longer than a year; just long enough to brush up my Spanish skills and have a new and exciting experience away from hectic London.  Almost five years later I'm still here!</p> 

		<p>I started teaching English to make ends meet and although I enjoy it, it's not really my passion.  I have been working hard to build up some clients to be able to get back into the fundraising that I was doing previously in London to be able to move away from teaching.</p>

		<p>I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I want to be able to offer a wider range of services to the charities that I work with, and maybe other organisations in the future too.</p>

		<h2>My Mission</h2>
		<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a freelance offering beautifully slick websites primarily for non-profits because I like to work in an environment where I feel my work is making a small contribution to the world.</p>

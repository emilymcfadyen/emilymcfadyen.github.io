		<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p>I reviewed a number of different websites using different styles and layouts and in the end I chose <a href="http://opx.co.uk">OPX</a> and <a href="http://glossier.com">Glossier</a> to compare.</p>

		<p>I chose the website of the creative agency, OPX, as I liked the grid design which is clear, simple and effectively gets the message across.</p>

		<p>The website for Glossier, a brand of skincare and make-up, caught my attention with its use of lots of negative space and unusual layout, with images spaced in an unbalanced way on the homepage. I also liked the use of black and white.</p>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
		<h3>OPX</h3>
		<p>There is a small amount of negative space on this site - just a border around the images which are arranged on a balanced grid.  There seem to be two focal points which lead you to examples of their work.  One is a video on the left and I found my eye drawn to that more that the other. Perhaps this is the real focal point?</p>

		<p>Below these focal points there are further boxes, this time smaller, and three per line rather than two. This flow of the page encourages you to explore and discover more examples of their work.</p>

		<p>The site uses responsive design - reorganising the boxes on the page as you adjust the size of your browser.</p>

		<h3>Glossier</h3>
		<p>The first images you see are three photos laid out in an unbalanced way, with captions which serve as the focal point to express the brand's identity and purpose.  As you can't click on any of these images for more information you are encouraged to scroll down to discover the product range.  When you hover the cursoe over these images, a different icon appears (instead of the arrow) for each picture, such as a palm tree or a crescent moon. I really liked this extra touch, although it was a bit confusing as it made me think I could click on the images.</p>

		<p>As you scroll down, each segment shows you just one image, of one product from their range, with a link to more information about that product.  The site also uses responsive design.</p>

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<p>The two websites are similar in the way that it seems they are both encouraging the user to explore, although in different ways.  The OPX website leaves the exploration to the user with the grid layout and no real focal point as you scroll down.  Although the Glossier website encourages the user to explore the product range by scrolling down, this is more hierarchical in nature with a clear order of priority in terms of the products that are displayed.</p>

		<p>Both sites use bold, clear images but the Glossier site uses a lot more negative space which also aids in focusing the user on a specific point.In both websites, their use of bold fonts and large images appealed to me.  I also liked the use of bold colours on the OPX website and the black and white on the Glossier website.</p>

		<p>Both websites seemed simple and easy to find the information you are looking for, although I perhaps preferred the Glossier website for this in the way that you can see just one product at a time. I found this more simple on the eye and my indecisive mind!</p>

		<h2>Thumbnail sketches</h2>
		<p>I have based these sketches on ideas for a portfolio website of my work:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Homepage</strong></li>
			<br>
			<img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0BwcHARTv1o9LWmphUXkzd0xrd0E" style="width:304px;height:228px">
			<br>
			<dt><i>Thumbnail 1:</i> The focal point would be a central section with my name and link to a bio about me. Below this, a grid of three images with examples of my work.</dt>
			<br>
			
			<img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0BwcHARTv1o9LUWx3Q0did1pzQ0U"style="width:304px;height:228px">
			<br>
			<dt><i>Thumbnail 2:</i> Using the same information but in a different layout, with  more negative space.  There is no focal point, but instead, three boxes with examples of my work encouraging the user to explore and find out more.  Below this would be a short introductino about me and my work.</dt>
			<br>
			
			<li><strong>Biography page</strong></li>
			<br>
			<img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0BwcHARTv1o9LN09RcEQ2UkxyblU"style="width:304px;height:228px">
			<br>
			<dt><i>Thumbnail 3:</i> This page is the bio page with more information about me.  I would keep it quite simple with a lot of white space, a large image and short description below with a further link back to more examples of work.</dt>
			<br>
			
			<img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0BwcHARTv1o9LWW5vZDFsdjg2a28"style="width:304px;height:228px">
			<dt><i>Thumbnail 4:</i> This page serves the same purpose as number three but with more information on the right hand side rather than below.</dt>
			<br>
			<li><strong>Examples of work page</strong></li>
			<br>
			<img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0BwcHARTv1o9LUkVCSE5ocDhpSTQ"style="width:304px;height:228px">
			<br>
			<dt><i>Thumbnail 5:</i> This page uses a grid layout to display examples of my work. The focal point would be the star project in a larger box on the left and then three more examples on the right.</dt>
			<br>
			
			<img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0BwcHARTv1o9LWnk2UEhCcFZodGc"style="width:304px;height:228px">
			<br>
			<dt><i>Thumbail 6:</i> Similar to number 6, this also shows examples of my work, but with no focal point encouraging the user to explore them.</dt>
		</ul>
